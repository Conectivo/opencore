0.18.0 (UNRELEASED)
===================

Features Added:

  * IWikiHistory page history cache objects now have a resync_history_cache
    method that will resync the cache w/ the canonical history in the
    portal_repository tool. (rafrombrc)

  * submit-error-report now also includes the logged in user id, if
    any. (slinkp)

  * Project content export is now linked from the top nav, and
    includes: wiki pages, file and image attachments, mailing list
    archive as an mbox file, mailing list subscribers and allowed
    senders as a csv file, and blog pages as a WXR file. (slinkp)

    Export is done asynchronously with an ajax UI in case it takes a
    long time. (slinkp)

  * Member deletion now works, and has a link from the account page.
    (slinkp)

  * Added 'sortable_title' index (w/ associated ISortableTitle indexing
    adapter) to portal_catalog. (rafrombrc)

  * Added IMemberRegisteredEvent and IPortraitModifiedEvent events, firing
    them at the appropriate places. (rafrombrc)

  * Added 'opencore.analytics' viewlet to allow easy inclusion of an
    analytics snippet in the IExtraBody viewlet manager. (rafrombrc)

  * Added support for optional 'include_time' argument to the pretty_date
    functions. (rafrombrc)

  * Wrapped status message div in a span tag with an id of
    'oc-statusMessage-container' to allow easy JS access to the entire
    status message portion of the DOM. (rafrombrc)

  * Email sender now includes the full name of the sender in the 'From:'
    header if we pass in a member id as the sender token. (rafrombrc)

  * Added IListenContainer interface to mark mailing list containers.
    (rafrombrc)

  * Added 'num_lists' method to the listen view to easily figure out how
    many mailing lists exist in a given project. (rafrombrc)

  * Added 'mail event' support to listen mailing lists, which allows
    customized reply messages to be generated and sent to users based
    on the specific error code a sent message generates.
    (rafrombrc, rmarianski)

  * Moved the viewlet 'save' processing to _before_ the main form save
    processing during the project edit handling so the viewlet save can
    scribble on the request form to impact the primary save. (rafrombrc)

  * Switched from 'profile_edit_sidebar' to 'profile_sidebar' for the
    profile sidebar viewlet manager since the same one is used for
    both the profile view and edit. (rafrombrc)

  * Added 'projects.json' API view against a member folder to allow
    external apps to get a JSON representation of a given member's
    active projects. (rafrombrc)

  * Added 'getSkills', 'sortable_title', and 'getWebsite' indexes to
    the member catalog (i.e. membrane_tool). (rafrombrc, rmarianski)

  * Added 'getLocation' index to portal_catalog. (rafrombrc)

  * Added 'interests' (formerly 'skills') method to member object.
    (rmarianski)

  * Added 'more_test_content' external method for easy generation of a
    bunch of extra test accounts. (rafrombrc)

  * Added support for featured projects to be selected by a site admin.
    (rmarianski)

  * Added FeedbackerClient utility to support fetching of data from
    feedbacker app if it is installed with the stack. (rafrombrc)

  * More info at the /stats view (try the link to active project stats)
    (pw)


Bugs Fixed:

  * Don't make clients download a new copy of obfuscation.js for every
    mailing list view they ever visit. (slinkp)

  * Switched from using view lookups by traversal to direct instantiation
    of the view classes in several tests so the tests don't fail when a
    different package is installed that has registered an override of the
    view in question. (rafrombrc)

  * Add support for returning 'never' as the 'made_active_date' on a team
    membership in the team view so we don't blow up when we hit a membership
    that isn't yet active. (rafrombrc)

  * Monkey (and un-Monkey) patch the StringIO classes in the test layers
    so they don't blow up when we pass unicode strings around. (rafrombrc)

  * Add some tweaks to the MailHost mock that the tests use so it will act
    nicely in places where the code expects a MaildropHost. (rafrombrc)


also on 0.17-dev (unreleased)
=============================

 * Correctly catch PIL-generated IOErrors on portrait uploads, w/
   improved notification and more correct behavior (rafrombrc)

0.17.1 (2009-06-30)
===================

Features Added:

 * Added PSM for successful invite-join so new members will have at least
   one obvious link to the projects they just joined. (rafrombrc)

 * After a successful invite-join, a new member is now redirected to the
   homepage of the project he just joined, instead of his generic "tour"
   page. (rafrombrc)

 * Added migrations/resync-page-history-caches.py zopectl script which will
   resynchronize all page history caches on a site. (#2836) (rafrombrc)

 * The infamous `project_noun` is now injected implicitly into all translation
   mappings, meaning ${project_noun} can be used in any translation without
   fear. (egj)

Bugs Fixed:

 * Wiki history no longer reports incorrect modification dates for
   individual versions of a page. Run resync-page-history-caches.py to
   fix existing content; see "Features" above. (#2836) (rafrombrc)

 * Added async project security reindex for succesful invite-joins. (rafrombrc)

 * Use English text as the default-of-last-resort for all internationalized
   strings if no translation is available in a given language. (egj)

 * Requesting membership to a project when the user already has a pending
   membership no longer causes a site error if the project's title contains
   non-ASCII characters. (#2807) (egj, tcoulter)

 * Account confirmation emails containing non-ASCII text were getting their
   click-to-confirm URL mangled. Confirmation emails are now properly
   encoded to quoted-printable to fix this. (#2808) (egj)

 * Some site emails were being sent with mangled headers when sent in French,
   Portugese and Spanish, causing them to appear in the user's inbox with no
   subject. (#2823) (egj, tcoulter)

 * Projects with non-ASCII titles can now be deleted without errors. (#2824)
   (egj, tcoulter)

 * Fixed broken interaction with Plone's Link Integrity Checker, which 
   was causing erroneous warnings about link integrity to be displayed to
   users in some circumstances of project deletion. (#2825) (egj, tcoulter)

 * Project members are now listed on the manage-team page in alphabetical
   order, case insensitive, sorted on username. (#2751) (egj)

 * Test member data now contains non-ASCII characters to provide better
   coverage re: i18n and l10n issues. (rafrombrc)

 * We now set Expires and Last-Modified headers on member portraits,
   for cacheability. (slinkp)


0.17.0 (2009-05-09)
===================

Data Migrations:

 * Run the upgrades through 0.17 using the portal_setup tool (see 0.15.0 
   change notes, below, for instructions) after you upgrade to 0.17. There
   are two migrations: one to mark "project-discussion" mailing lists with
   a marker interface (about which see "Mailing lists now support..." below)
   and another to retitle member areas (#2779 and see below)


Features Added:

 * Wiki pages now have a view at `latest-change` which redirects to the
   `version_compare` page displaying the most recent edit on the page. It
   is linked from the "last modified" text in the tabs on the page's standard
   view. (#2781) (egj)

 * A portal status message now notifies users when their wiki content
   is stripped out because of the allowed_hosts whitelist, a frequent
   point of confusion for end users. (#2793) (egj)

 * Paginated search results now include a "jump to page" option (#1488) (egj)

 * All contexts now have a view at `searching` which returns a paginated
   list of all contents published underneath the given context. It is not
   yet linked to anywhere in the UI. (egj)

 * Rename 'pages' back to 'wiki' (#2749) (egj)

 * Mailing lists now support an ISyncWithProjectMembership marker interface;
   any list marked with this interface will automatically subscribe and
   unsubscribe members as they are added to or removed from a project.
   This used to only work for mailing lists with a specific id based on
   the project name; run the "Mark ISyncWithProjectMembership on -discussion
   lists" migration in opencore.upgrades.to_0_17_0" to retain the functionality.
   (rafrombrc)

 * More templates marked up for translation. (egj)

 * The infamous `project_noun` is now marked up for translation. (#2739) (egj)

 * Xinha UI is now localizable (#2730) It respects the registered
   implementation of zope.i18n.interfaces.IUserPreferredLanguages
   to determine language preferences. (egj)
 

Bugs Fixed:

 * The topnav within a member space was always displaying the member's original
   Title (i.e. fullname?fullname:id) as it was set at account creation time. It
   now properly displays the member's current Title at all times (#2779) (egj)

 * Thumbnail view on the attachment images now explicitly sets content type
   header as image/jpeg (rafrombrc)


Refactoring:

 * Extracted opencore.wordpress into its own egg as a plugin (#2715) (egj)

 * Heavily refactored `BaseView.area` and `BaseView.window_title` functions 
   in `opencore.browser.base` (#588#comment:7 and following) (egj)

 * Heavily refactored `opencore.nui.main.search` module and related views (egj)

 * Optimization: cut down on number of catalog queries in forgot view (rmarianski)


0.16.0 (2009-02-27)
===================

Features Added:

 * ProjectInfoView.project (aka BaseView.piv.project) now takes
   advantage of special HTTP headers for specifying a default project
   if there's none in the acquisition context. (Deliverance has
   apparently provided these headers for a while, and we already use
   them in the top nav, but we haven't used them in this view.) To use
   this, the proxy server can set headers X-Openplans-Application to
   anything other than 'zope', and X-Openplans-Project to the ID of
   the project. (slinkp, rmarianski)

 * More templates marked up for translation. (slinkp, dimo)

Bugs Fixed:

 * Fixed a bug in utility.email_sender that prevented keyword args
   from being used in translation interpolation as expected (slinkp)

 * Fixed invite reminder email so the message gets correctly
   translated including the passed variables (slinkp)

 * Fixed unicode decode error in member contact form (and hopefully avoid
   related errors on other pages). (#2768) (slinkp)

 * RSS feeds of wiki page history was prohibitively expensive. Fixed.
   (#2766) (slinkp)

 * The user folder ID migration fix from opencore 0.14 (see below)
   would barf on a few mysterious users. We work around that now,
   although the real fix is to upgrade membrane, which is done in the
   latest Products bundle.  (slinkp)

 * The member area title migration was tweaked to avoid some unnecessary
   data changes, and commit every so often to avoid conflict errors.
   (slinkp)

 * The workflow update migration was refactored to commit every so
   often, to avoid conflict errors. (slinkp)

 * Project summary now correctly shows the blank slate version of the
   BlogSummaryViewlet when there are no blog posts. (slinkp, jhammel)


Refactoring:

 * Optimization: Memoize BaseView.piv and BaseView.miv, to allow those
   views' own memoizations to be useful. (slinkp)

 * Working toward eliminating redundant opencore.nui.email_sender (slinkp)

0.15.0 (2008-12-22)
===================


Data Migrations:

 * You will need to use the portal_setup tool to run all the upgrades
   through 0.15. This is done the usual way: In the ZMI, go to
   openplans/portal_setup/manage_upgrades , select the
   opencore.configuration profile, and run all the available upgrades.

   WARNING, it is not known whether you can safely downgrade after
   running these migrations.  We always recommend making backups and
   testing with a copy of live data before you upgrade for real.


Features:

 * Partial translations of the UI into Spanish, French & Portuguese
   (dimo, thiago, pierre & the OpenFSM team)

 * Member objects now have a _change_member_id() method. This is not
   exposed by UI yet, but admins can use it in eg. zopectl debug.

 * Member profile now has a "contact" button which links to a mail
   form. The member's email address is not exposed. (slinkp, rafrombrc)

 * We now use the member's full name (by way of Title()) in most
   places that conceptually refer to a person, and the member's ID
   only in places that refer to the account. Fixes openplans:#2740
   (slinkp)

 * Mailing lists now have a /membership view that non-Managers can
   see.  Includes a link to each member's contact form. Email
   addresses are not exposed.  Sorted case-insensitively by member
   Title or email. (closes openplans:#2752; partially closes
   openplans:#2751) (slinkp)

 * Mailing lists' manage_membership page now includes links to
   members' contact form, and is sorted case-insensitively by member
   Title or email address. (Partially closes openplans:#2751) (slinkp)

 * When inviting a site member to join a project, it is now possible to
   customize the email message sent (closes openplans:#2741) (egj)

 * Marked up a few more strings for translation (slinkp)

 * There is now a rebuild_i18n script for conveniently merging new
   message ids into all the .po files, and generating the test az
   "translation". See for more info:
   http://www.openplans.org/projects/opencore/i18n-usage-in-opencore
   (slinkp)

 * opencore.utils now includes a simple in-memory timestamp_memoize()
   for caching expensive calls (rafrombrc)

 * Added a manual.pot file to manually manage strings from zcml files
   which can't be parsed automatically by i18ndude (dimo)

 * Added viewlet for analytics JS snippets (rafrombrc)


Bug fixes:

 * Fix a longstanding point of user confusion, openplans:#1474. The member
   search in team management view no longer ignores existing team members
   but instead displays them with a contextual note that they are already
   in the project. (egj)

 * Account creation forms no longer explode when the id contains '('
   or ')'. (egj)

 * "Delete" button on project contents page now is shown or hidden
   based on correct permission check. There is a GS upgradeStep to fix
   existing workflows. (rafrombrc)

 * The 'addable types' setting for the OpenTeam types was incorrect;
   it was set to all implicitly allowable types instead of explicitly
   allowing OpenMembership (and nothing else).  Edited the GS profile
   to reflect the new setting and added an upgradeStep to automate its
   application. (rafrombrc)

 * The create-az.py script now reliably finds all message ids, is less
   likely to produce invalid output, and doesn't care what directory
   you're in. (slinkp)

 * Many flunc tests are slightly less fragile (slinkp)

 * Unit tests no longer fail when VerboseSecurity is enabled (slinkp)

 * Fix unicode errors in project preferences view (dimo, novalis)

 * Fix unicode errors in request-membership view (dimo)

 * Wiki attachments now have unique ids based on full path
   (closes http://trac.openplans.org/openplans/ticket/2728) (novalis)

 * Fixed AttributeError when anonymous user requests project
   membership (http://trac.openplans.org/openplans/ticket/2735) (dimo)

 * Slightly more useful error message on project creation when URL
   does not contain enough ASCII characters
   (http://trac.openplans.org/openplans/ticket/2733) (egj)

 * opencore.utility.email_sender now does quoted-printable encoding of
   headers when it gets anything that can't be encoded as ascii.
   (slinkp)

 * opencore.utility.email_sender is now a bit smarter about
   addresses. (slinkp)
  

Refactoring:

 * Optimization: Cache number of users and projects for 10 minutes
   (rafrombrc)

 * simplify OpenMember's validate_id and do most expensive/brittle
   checks last (egj)

 * Removed obsolete do_nothing.py, which was a workaround for Plone < 3 
   (slinkp)

 * Remove more subproject cruft (openplans:#2670) (egj)

 * Remove topnav cruft (openplans:#2581) (egj)

 * Remove BaseView.get_view cruft (egj)


0.14.1 (2008/11/07)
===================

Data Migrations:

 * The migration needed for 0.14.0 has been rewritten to work as a
   standard GenericSetup upgrade.  You can now upgrade via the
   portal_setup tool in the ZMI; go to the upgrades tab and run the
   upgrade registered for version 0.14.0.

   (The script also still exists at migrations/update_member_project_ids.py 
   if you prefer to run it via zopectl.)

Features:

 * Added i18n for some wiki history views, if you can call that a feature.

Bug fixes:

 * List manager address was showing up as escaped HTML.
   (slinkp) (openplans:#2706)

 * Wiki version view doesn't error when no version_id is specified
   (slinkp) (http://trac.openplans.org/errors-openplans/ticket/30)

 * Error page doesn't barf on 404s if the catalog has a problem coming
   up with suggestions based on the current URL (slinkp)
   (http://trac.openplans.org/errors-openplans/ticket/23)

 * Fixed rare error in recataloging projects, raised by
   the project's _default_img_data method. (slinkp)

Refactoring:

 * Removed a ton of FormLite and Octopus cruft from opencore/browser.
   Everything left is in opencore/browser/formhandler.py, with more
   tests. (slinkp)


0.14.0 (2008/10/02)
===================

This is mostly a bugfix release, but it does contain a couple of small
enhancements.

Data Migrations:

 * There is one migration script that you should run after upgrading:
   zopectl run opencore/migrations/update_member_project_ids.py
   See the list of bug fixes below for details.


Features:

 * search engine optimization tweaks (novalis)

 * Added per-project security context page for twirlip and other uses 
   at projects/foo/security-context (novalis)

 * Add twirlip transclusion link for wiki pages. (novalis)


Bug fixes and non-featureful changes:

 * Fix bug in reindex_member_project_ids that could prevent a member
   from showing up on a private project's team page.
   (slinkp) (http://trac.openplans.org/errors-openplans/ticket/36)

   This fix prevents the problem from happening in the future;
   to fix your existing data, run this script once after upgrading:
   zopectl run opencore/migrations/update_member_project_ids.py

 * Work around rare bug where a pending member doesn't have a
   confirmation code.
   (http://trac.openplans.org/errors-openplans/ticket/49)
   (slinkp)

 * Fix stats view, broken by plone3 upgrade (cabraham, slinkp)

 * Memoize member and project lists in ProjectTeamView for
   performance; change names for clarity. (slinkp)

 * Fix upgrades/to_0_13_0.py to actually migrate all the mailing lists
   (rafrombrc et al.)

 * Wiki history "Last edit performed by..." now correctly shows the
   last edit, not the first. (slinkp) (ticket #2704)

 * Show a useful error message when doing wiki version comparison
   against an old binary upload. (slinkp) (errors-openplans #31)

 * Fixed: errors on invalid input to contact-site-admin page. (slinkp)
   (http://trac.openplans.org/errors-openplans/ticket/43)

 * Fixed: potential Unicode errors in email_sender (slinkp).
   (http://trac.openplans.org/errors-openplans/ticket/44)

 * Fixed: potential AttributeError when deleting images (rmarianski)
   (http://trac.openplans.org/errors-openplans/ticket/9)

   (rmarianski)
   (http://trac.openplans.org/errors-openplans/ticket/8
    and http://trac.openplans.org/errors-openplans/ticket/5)

 * Wiki edit: removing the isempty attributes that xinha inserts is
   better than just making them blank (rmarianski)

 * Add a separate template for the invite join page if we don't have
   all the request variables. (rmarianski)
   (http://trac.openplans.org/errors-openplans/ticket/6)

 * Remove more subproject-related cruft from opencore.project. (slinkp)

 * CSS: on oc tabs action links, don't use a transparent background
   for the selected link. (rmarianski)

 * Fixed: Base view now uses the *external* path so that twirlip knows
   where to send the form. (novalis)

 * Various refactoring, code cleanup, css tweaks (everybody)


0.13.0 (2008/08/12)
===================

 * Code migrated to Zope 2.10 / Plone 3.0, older versions no longer supported.
   This requires database migrations that cannot be undone, so make backups

For associated migration steps, see docs/0.9.7.7-migrations.txt in
this repository.

This list is incomplete; we didn't keep a changelog, and we failed to
make tags for any 0.9.7.7 deployments, so it would be a big project to
retroactively reconstruct this.

If anybody cares, a good place to start might be:
svn log https://svn.openplans.org/svn/opencore/trunk -r11482:10870
... to get the changes since 0.9.7.6, and then:
svn log --stop-on-copy https://svn.openplans.org/svn/opencore/branches/0.9.7.7
... to get the changes on the 0.9.7.7 branch.


0.9.7.6d tagged 2007-12-14
==========================

 * keep-alive fixes for remote-auth email updates

0.9.7.6c tagged 2007-12-06

0.9.7.6b tagged 2007-12-06

We didn't keep a changelog before this; a brave/crazy person could
retroactively fill the below releases in from svn history...

0.9.7.6a tagged 2007-11-28
==========================

0.9.7.6 branched 2007-11-09
===========================

From http://openplans.org/projects/opencore/openplans-release-notes --
 * Project Logos
 * Tour page icons
 * Everything search issue (#1689)

From http://openplans.org/projects/opencore/openplans-deployment-notes --
Required migrations:
 * The fix for #1689 needs a catalog reindex after zope restarts: go into the ZMI, go to /openplans/portal_catalog/manage_catalogAdvanced, and click the "Update Catalog" button. This might take a while.
 * If you are integrating OpenCore with TaskTracker in your stack, the TaskTracker source should be updated to the head of trunk [ed note: would be nice to find out what revision we're talking about here and why]
