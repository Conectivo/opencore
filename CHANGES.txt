0.14.1 (2008/10/06)
===================

Data Migrations:

 * The migration needed for 0.14.0 has been rewritten to work as a
   standard GenericSetup upgrade.  You can now upgrade via the
   portal_setup tool in the ZMI; go to the upgrades tab and run the
   upgrade registered for version 0.14.0.
   The script also still exists at
   migrations/update_member_project_ids.py if you prefer to run it via
   zopectl.

Features:

 * Added i18n for some wiki history views, if you can call that a feature.

Bug fixes:

 * List manager address was showing up as escaped HTML.
   (slinkp) (openplans:#2706)

 * Wiki version view doesn't error when no version_id is specified
   (slinkp) (http://trac.openplans.org/errors-openplans/ticket/30)

 * Error page doesn't barf on 404s if the catalog has a problem coming
   up with suggestions based on the current URL (slinkp)
   (http://trac.openplans.org/errors-openplans/ticket/23)

 * Fixed rare error in recataloging projects, raised by
   the project's _default_img_data method. (slinkp)



0.14.0 (2008/10/02)
===================

This is mostly a bugfix release, but it does contain a couple of small
enhancements.

Data Migrations:

 * There is one migration script that you should run after upgrading:
   zopectl run opencore/migrations/update_member_project_ids.py
   See the list of bug fixes below for details.


Features:

 * search engine optimization tweaks (novalis)

 * Added per-project security context page for twirlip and other uses 
   at projects/foo/security-context (novalis)

   from showing up on a private project's team page.
   (slinkp) (http://trac.openplans.org/errors-openplans/ticket/36)

   to fix your existing data, run this script once after upgrading:

We didn't keep a changelog before this release.


0.9.7.7 branched 2007-11-30
===========================

We didn't keep a changelog, and we failed to make tags for any 0.9.7.7
deployments, so it would be a big project to retroactively reconstruct
this.

If anybody cares, a good place to start might be:
svn log https://svn.openplans.org/svn/opencore/trunk -r11482:10870
... to get the changes since 0.9.7.6, and then:
svn log --stop-on-copy https://svn.openplans.org/svn/opencore/branches/0.9.7.7
... to get the changes on the 0.9.7.7 branch.


0.9.7.6d tagged 2007-12-14
==========================

 * keep-alive fixes for remote-auth email updates

0.9.7.6c tagged 2007-12-06

 * Fixes remote-auth deadlocks


0.9.7.6b tagged 2007-12-06
==========================

 * Minor fixes to the "contact us" page

We didn't keep a changelog before this; a brave/crazy person could
retroactively fill the below releases in from svn history...
