We didn't keep a changelog before this release.


0.9.7.7 branched 2007-11-30
===========================

We didn't keep a changelog, and we failed to make tags for any 0.9.7.7
deployments, so it would be a big project to retroactively reconstruct
this.

If anybody cares, a good place to start might be:
svn log https://svn.openplans.org/svn/opencore/trunk -r11482:10870
... to get the changes since 0.9.7.6, and then:
svn log --stop-on-copy https://svn.openplans.org/svn/opencore/branches/0.9.7.7
... to get the changes on the 0.9.7.7 branch.
