0.17.0 (UNRELEASED)
===================

novalis, rmarianski have made changes since r22524 without updating
the changelog. Please do so.

Features Added:

 * Wiki pages now have a view at `latest-change` which redirects to the
   `version_compare` page displaying the most recent edit on the page. It
   is linked from the "last modified" text in the tabs on the page's standard
   view. (#2781) (egj)

 * Rename 'pages' back to 'wiki' (#2749) (egj)

 * Mailing lists now support an ISyncWithProjectMembership marker interface;
   any list marked with this interface will automatically subscribe and
   unsubscribe members as they are added to or removed from a project.
   (This used to only work for mailing lists with a specific id based on
   the project name.) (rafrombrc)

Bugs Fixed:

 * The topnav within a member space was always displaying the member's original
   Title (i.e. fullname?fullname:id) as it was set at account creation time. It
   now properly displays the member's current Title at all times (#2779) (egj)

 * Thumbnail view on the attachment images now explicitly sets content type
   header as image/jpeg (rafrombrc)

Refactoring:

 * Extracted opencore.wordpress into its own egg as a plugin (#2715) (egj)

 * Heavily refactored `BaseView.area` and `BaseView.window_title` functions 
   in `opencore.browser.base` (#588#comment:7 and following) (egj)

0.16.0 (2009-02-27)
===================

Features Added:

 * ProjectInfoView.project (aka BaseView.piv.project) now takes
   advantage of special HTTP headers for specifying a default project
   if there's none in the acquisition context. (Deliverance has
   apparently provided these headers for a while, and we already use
   them in the top nav, but we haven't used them in this view.) To use
   this, the proxy server can set headers X-Openplans-Application to
   anything other than 'zope', and X-Openplans-Project to the ID of
   the project. (slinkp, rmarianski)

 * More templates marked up for translation.

Bugs Fixed:

 * Fixed a bug in utility.email_sender that prevented keyword args
   from being used in translation interpolation as expected (slinkp)

 * Fixed invite reminder email so the message gets correctly
   translated including the passed variables (slinkp)

 * Fixed unicode decode error in member contact form (and hopefully avoid
   related errors on other pages). (#2768) (slinkp)

 * RSS feeds of wiki page history was prohibitively expensive. Fixed.
   (#2766) (slinkp)

 * The user folder ID migration fix from opencore 0.14 (see below)
   would barf on a few mysterious users. We work around that now,
   although the real fix is to upgrade membrane, which is done in the
   latest Products bundle.  (slinkp)

 * The member area title migration was tweaked to avoid some unnecessary
   data changes, and commit every so often to avoid conflict errors.
   (slinkp)

 * The workflow update migration was refactored to commit every so
   often, to avoid conflict errors. (slinkp)

 * Project summary now correctly shows the blank slate version of the
   BlogSummaryViewlet when there are no blog posts. (slinkp, jhammel)


Refactoring:

 * Optimization: Memoize BaseView.piv and BaseView.miv, to allow those
   views' own memoizations to be useful. (slinkp)

 * Working toward eliminating redundant opencore.nui.email_sender (slinkp)

0.15.0 (2008-12-22)
===================


Data Migrations:

 * You will need to use the portal_setup tool to run all the upgrades
   through 0.15. This is done the usual way: In the ZMI, go to
   openplans/portal_setup/manage_upgrades , select the
   opencore.configuration profile, and run all the available upgrades.

   WARNING, it is not known whether you can safely downgrade after
   running these migrations.  We always recommend making backups and
   testing with a copy of live data before you upgrade for real.


Features:

 * Partial translations of the UI into Spanish, French & Portuguese
   (dimo)

 * Member objects now have a _change_member_id() method. This is not
   exposed by UI yet, but admins can use it in eg. zopectl debug.

 * Member profile now has a "contact" button which links to a mail
   form. The member's email address is not exposed. (slinkp, rafrombrc)

 * We now use the member's full name (by way of Title()) in most
   places that conceptually refer to a person, and the member's ID
   only in places that refer to the account. Fixes openplans:#2740
   (slinkp)

 * Mailing lists now have a /membership view that non-Managers can
   see.  Includes a link to each member's contact form. Email
   addresses are not exposed.  Sorted case-insensitively by member
   Title or email. (closes openplans:#2752; partially closes
   openplans:#2751) (slinkp)

 * Mailing lists' manage_membership page now includes links to
   members' contact form, and is sorted case-insensitively by member
   Title or email address. (Partially closes openplans:#2751) (slinkp)

 * When inviting a site member to join a project, it is now possible to
   customize the email message sent (closes openplans:#2741) (egj)

 * Marked up a few more strings for translation (slinkp)

 * There is now a rebuild_i18n script for conveniently merging new
   message ids into all the .po files, and generating the test az
   "translation". See for more info:
   http://www.openplans.org/projects/opencore/i18n-usage-in-opencore
   (slinkp)

 * opencore.utils now includes a simple in-memory timestamp_memoize()
   for caching expensive calls (rafrombrc)

 * Added a manual.pot file to manually manage strings from zcml files
   which can't be parsed automatically by i18ndude (dimo)

 * Added viewlet for analytics JS snippets (rafrombrc)


Bug fixes:

 * Fix a longstanding point of user confusion, openplans:#1474. The member
   search in team management view no longer ignores existing team members
   but instead displays them with a contextual note that they are already
   in the project. (egj)

 * Account creation forms no longer explode when the id contains '('
   or ')'. (egj)

 * "Delete" button on project contents page now is shown or hidden
   based on correct permission check. There is a GS upgradeStep to fix
   existing workflows. (rafrombrc)

 * The 'addable types' setting for the OpenTeam types was incorrect;
   it was set to all implicitly allowable types instead of explicitly
   allowing OpenMembership (and nothing else).  Edited the GS profile
   to reflect the new setting and added an upgradeStep to automate its
   application. (rafrombrc)

 * The create-az.py script now reliably finds all message ids, is less
   likely to produce invalid output, and doesn't care what directory
   you're in. (slinkp)

 * Many flunc tests are slightly less fragile (slinkp)

 * Unit tests no longer fail when VerboseSecurity is enabled (slinkp)

 * Fix unicode errors in project preferences view (dimo, novalis)

 * Fix unicode errors in request-membership view (dimo)

 * Wiki attachments now have unique ids based on full path
   (closes http://trac.openplans.org/openplans/ticket/2728) (novalis)

 * Fixed AttributeError when anonymous user requests project
   membership (http://trac.openplans.org/openplans/ticket/2735) (dimo)

 * Slightly more useful error message on project creation when URL
   does not contain enough ASCII characters
   (http://trac.openplans.org/openplans/ticket/2733) (egj)

 * opencore.utility.email_sender now does quoted-printable encoding of
   headers when it gets anything that can't be encoded as ascii.
   (slinkp)

 * opencore.utility.email_sender is now a bit smarter about
   addresses. (slinkp)
  

Refactoring:

 * Optimization: Cache number of users and projects for 10 minutes
   (rafrombrc)

 * simplify OpenMember's validate_id and do most expensive/brittle
   checks last (egj)

 * Removed obsolete do_nothing.py, which was a workaround for Plone < 3 
   (slinkp)

 * Remove more subproject cruft (openplans:#2670) (egj)

 * Remove topnav cruft (openplans:#2581) (egj)

 * Remove BaseView.get_view cruft (egj)


0.14.1 (2008/11/07)
===================

Data Migrations:

 * The migration needed for 0.14.0 has been rewritten to work as a
   standard GenericSetup upgrade.  You can now upgrade via the
   portal_setup tool in the ZMI; go to the upgrades tab and run the
   upgrade registered for version 0.14.0.

   (The script also still exists at migrations/update_member_project_ids.py 
   if you prefer to run it via zopectl.)

Features:

 * Added i18n for some wiki history views, if you can call that a feature.

Bug fixes:

 * List manager address was showing up as escaped HTML.
   (slinkp) (openplans:#2706)

 * Wiki version view doesn't error when no version_id is specified
   (slinkp) (http://trac.openplans.org/errors-openplans/ticket/30)

 * Error page doesn't barf on 404s if the catalog has a problem coming
   up with suggestions based on the current URL (slinkp)
   (http://trac.openplans.org/errors-openplans/ticket/23)

 * Fixed rare error in recataloging projects, raised by
   the project's _default_img_data method. (slinkp)

Refactoring:

 * Removed a ton of FormLite and Octopus cruft from opencore/browser.
   Everything left is in opencore/browser/formhandler.py, with more
   tests. (slinkp)


0.14.0 (2008/10/02)
===================

This is mostly a bugfix release, but it does contain a couple of small
enhancements.

Data Migrations:

 * There is one migration script that you should run after upgrading:
   zopectl run opencore/migrations/update_member_project_ids.py
   See the list of bug fixes below for details.


Features:

 * search engine optimization tweaks (novalis)

 * Added per-project security context page for twirlip and other uses 
   at projects/foo/security-context (novalis)

 * Add twirlip transclusion link for wiki pages. (novalis)


Bug fixes and non-featureful changes:

 * Fix bug in reindex_member_project_ids that could prevent a member
   from showing up on a private project's team page.
   (slinkp) (http://trac.openplans.org/errors-openplans/ticket/36)

   This fix prevents the problem from happening in the future;
   to fix your existing data, run this script once after upgrading:
   zopectl run opencore/migrations/update_member_project_ids.py

 * Work around rare bug where a pending member doesn't have a
   confirmation code.
   (http://trac.openplans.org/errors-openplans/ticket/49)
   (slinkp)

 * Fix stats view, broken by plone3 upgrade (cabraham, slinkp)

 * Memoize member and project lists in ProjectTeamView for
   performance; change names for clarity. (slinkp)

 * Fix upgrades/to_0_13_0.py to actually migrate all the mailing lists
   (rafrombrc et al.)

 * Wiki history "Last edit performed by..." now correctly shows the
   last edit, not the first. (slinkp) (ticket #2704)

 * Show a useful error message when doing wiki version comparison
   against an old binary upload. (slinkp) (errors-openplans #31)

 * Fixed: errors on invalid input to contact-site-admin page. (slinkp)
   (http://trac.openplans.org/errors-openplans/ticket/43)

 * Fixed: potential Unicode errors in email_sender (slinkp).
   (http://trac.openplans.org/errors-openplans/ticket/44)

   handler (slinkp)
   (http://trac.openplans.org/errors-openplans/ticket/38)

   (rmarianski)
   (http://trac.openplans.org/errors-openplans/ticket/8
    and http://trac.openplans.org/errors-openplans/ticket/5)

 * Wiki edit: removing the isempty attributes that xinha inserts is
   better than just making them blank (rmarianski)

 * Add a separate template for the invite join page if we don't have
   all the request variables. (rmarianski)
   (http://trac.openplans.org/errors-openplans/ticket/6)

 * Remove more subproject-related cruft from opencore.project. (slinkp)

 * CSS: on oc tabs action links, don't use a transparent background
   for the selected link. (rmarianski)

 * Fixed: Base view now uses the *external* path so that twirlip knows
   where to send the form. (novalis)

 * Various refactoring, code cleanup, css tweaks (everybody)


0.13.0 (2008/08/12)
===================

 * Code migrated to Zope 2.10 / Plone 3.0, older versions no longer supported.
   This requires database migrations that cannot be undone, so make backups
   and test thoroughly! See for more instructions:
   https://svn.openplans.org/svn/opencore/trunk/docs/Plone2.5-Plone3-migration.txt

We didn't keep a changelog before this release.


0.9.7.7 branched 2007-11-30
===========================

We didn't keep a changelog, and we failed to make tags for any 0.9.7.7
deployments, so it would be a big project to retroactively reconstruct
this.

svn log https://svn.openplans.org/svn/opencore/trunk -r11482:10870
... to get the changes since 0.9.7.6, and then:
svn log --stop-on-copy https://svn.openplans.org/svn/opencore/branches/0.9.7.7
... to get the changes on the 0.9.7.7 branch.
