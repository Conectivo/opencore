OpenCore makes heavy use of the Zope Component Architecture (ZCA), a
framework for supporting component-based design and programming.  This
means that it is possible to customize, extend, override or replace
nearly every piece of the OpenCore system for your deployment's
needs. The downside to this flexibility is that developing stable and
maintainable customizations requires a lot of experience with OpenCore
itself, with the ZCA, and with the particular ways in which the ZCA is
used in OpenCore and Plone.  Since you can change almost anything in
the system without upstream cooperation, your changes may have
unexpected consequences in far-off parts of the system, and there is
no way to guarantee that your customizations will work when you
upgrade OpenCore.

So OpenCore provides its own set of customization points, mainly as a
layer on top of its use of the ZCA.  These "supported" customization
points allow you to extend your OpenCore system with less deep general
knowledge, and in a way that will continue to work with future
OpenCore releases.  

Depending on your needs you may still need to drop down to the general
layer to customize your site.  If you do, please let us know, so that
we can see if there is a way to build a supported customization point
to address your needs.
