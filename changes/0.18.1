0.18.1 (unreleased)
===================

 * Add optional `layer` attribute to opencore:searchView directive (dimo)

 * Add <meta http-equiv="Content-type"> tag with charset=UTF-8 declaration
   to the main-template.pt <head>. This prevents non-ASCII response content
   from becoming mangled if it's passed through an lxml filter on the way out.
