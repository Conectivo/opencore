0.18.1 (unreleased)
===================

 * Add optional `layer` attribute to opencore:searchView directive (dimo)

 * Add <meta http-equiv="Content-type"> tag with charset=UTF-8 declaration
   to main-template.pt <head>. This prevents non-ASCII response content from
   being mangled if it's passed through an lxml filter on the way out (egj)

 * Fix #2899 (egj)

 * Add `opencore.browser.interfaces.IExtraFooter` viewlet manager to let
   additional content be plugged in to the site footer.
   
 * Add @@becoming-a-member view on the site root. It is looked up and
   rendered in the @@join and @@invite-join views, on their sidebars.
   Previously @@join and @@invite-join each had (very similary) hardcoded
   text on their sidebars.

   This view can be overridden to customize the "Becoming a member means.."
   sidebar widget.

 * Render @@becoming-a-member in the sidebar of the @@request-membership
   view on projects when the requesting user is not logged in.

 * On @@request-membership, display a sidebar widget with the project's name
   and description if the project has a non-empty description.

   (The code for this already existed in the template but was commented out.)
