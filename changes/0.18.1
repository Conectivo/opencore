0.18.1 (unreleased)
===================

 * Add optional `layer` attribute to opencore:searchView directive (dimo)

 * Add <meta http-equiv="Content-type"> tag with charset=UTF-8 declaration
   to main-template.pt <head>. This prevents non-ASCII response content from
   being mangled if it's passed through an lxml filter on the way out (egj)

 * Fix #2899 (egj)

 * Add `opencore.browser.interfaces.IExtraFooter` viewlet manager to let
   additional content be plugged in to the site footer.
   
 * Add @@becoming-a-member view on the site root. It is looked up and
   rendered in the @@join and @@invite-join views, on their sidebars.
   Previously @@join and @@invite-join each had (very similary) hardcoded
   text on their sidebars.

   This view can be overridden to customize the "Becoming a member means.."
   sidebar widget.

 * Render @@becoming-a-member in the sidebar of the @@request-membership
   view on projects when the requesting user is not logged in.

 * On @@request-membership, display a sidebar widget with the project's name
   and description if the project has a non-empty description.

   (The code for this already existed in the template but was commented out.)

 * Add a view @@raw-view on IOpenPage objects which renders the page's HTML
   content without any styling or modification, and without the site chrome.

 * Add a `opencore.account.viewlet_manager.ICreateAccount` viewlet manager
   which is registered for the @@join, @@request-membership and @@invite-join
   views, to allow (e.g.) extra form fields to be plugged into the signup forms.

   The views follow the same (gunky) pattern for pluggable validation and form
   response handling as the Project Preferences view -- viewlets can plug-in
   their own form validation with a `.validate(self)` method and can plug-in
   successful submission handlers with a `.save(self)` method.

 * The account creation form's ajax validation no longer says 'Passwords do
   not match' before the user has filled out the password-confirmation field. 
   (#2896)

 * Moved conditional "watch/unwatch" control on wiki pages to the RHS tabs
   alongside view/edit/history to take up less screen space and keep all
   page-level controls in one place. Change requested by Strypey, see
   http://coactivate.org/projects/openplans-users-group/lists/openplans-users-group-discussion/archive/2010/06/1276143282024/forum_view

 * Fix untranslated literal string "${last_change_pretty_mod_date}" in wiki history
