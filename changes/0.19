0.19.0 (unreleased)
===================

 * Updated Greek translation. (dimo)

 * Project content export is now linked from the top nav, and
   includes: wiki pages, file and image attachments, mailing list
   archive as an mbox file, mailing list subscribers and allowed
   senders as a csv file, and blog pages as a WXR file. (slinkp)

   Export is done asynchronously with an ajax UI in case it takes a
   long time. (slinkp)

 * Added "Search by location" functionality to the People Search.

 * Added a "Sort by location" option to the People Search.

 * On a People Search, for each search result displayed, display the 
   list of projects that the member is a part of, so that users can 
   browse for projects with members matching a search query.

 * Be more strict about filtering out unlisted memberships early,
   to avoid displaying unlisted memberships.  Specifically, the
   `project_ids` index on the membrane_tool, and the `project_ids()`
   method on OpenMember objects, has been redefined to only return
   listed memberships.

   This change requires that the project_ids index on membrane_tool
   be reindexed and possibly even removed and recreated.

 * Provide RSS/Atom feeds for the site news folder.

   Currently requires that you manually mark the site news folder 
   with ICanFeed marker interface via ZMI.

 * The ordering of options in a SearchView's sortable_fields template
   is now preserved.

   Implementation note: SearchView.sort_by_options now returns a 2-tuple 
   instead of a dict.  This should not affect you unless you are heavily
   customizing a SearchView and calling view.sort_by_options() directly
   (the default is to call the @@nui_batch_macros/sort_widget which renders
   the sort options)
