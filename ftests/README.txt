This is a suite of Flunc[1] functional tests for openplans (mostly the
opencore part of it).

To run these tests, you need to create a file named admin.conf in this
directory, containing the username and password of a Zope user with
"Manager" privileges.  Normally, this is done automatically by a
Fassembler[2] build script.
