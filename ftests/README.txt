This is a suite of Flunc[1] functional tests for openplans (mostly the
opencore part of it).

To run these tests, you need a file named admin.conf in this directory,
containing the username and password of a Zope user with "Manager" privileges.
Normally, this file is created automatically by a Fassembler[2] build script.
If you're not using fassembler or otherwise need to edit this file, look at
admin.conf.example for the proper format to use.
