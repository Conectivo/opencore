Make sure the RequestMembershipWithEmail adapter is hooked up::
    >>> team = portal.portal_teams.p1
    >>> from opencore.interfaces.pending_requests import IRequestMembership
    >>> rm = IRequestMembership(team)
    >>> rm
    <opencore.nui.project.team_membership.RequestMembershipWithEmail object ...>

The logged in user can request membership to the project::
    >>> rm.join()
    True

If the user is not able to request membership, we'll find out::
    >>> rm.join()
    False
