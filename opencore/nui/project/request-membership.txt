 Project Request Membership View
================================

First we set a project up w/ a membership invitation and a membership
request so we've got some more useful data.

    >>> proj = self.portal.projects.p3 # <-- m1 is ProjectAdmin
    >>> team = proj.getTeams()[0]
    >>> self.logout()
    >>> self.login('m4') # <-- m4 not on team
    >>> request = self.portal.REQUEST
    >>> from opencore.nui.project.view import RequestMembershipView
    >>> view = RequestMembershipView(proj, request)

Set up the form data, and request membership
    >>> view.request.form = {'request-message': 'i like your project'}
    >>> view.request_membership()
    >>> del view._redirected # necessary to display portal status message
    >>> view.portal_status_message
    [u'Your request to join "Project Three" has been sent to the project administrators.']

Verify membership object is in the pending state now
    >>> wft = view.get_tool('portal_workflow')
    >>> mship = team._getOb('m4')
    >>> wft.getInfoFor(mship, 'review_state')
    'pending'

Now, we simulate an admin rejecting
    >>> self.logout()
    >>> self.loginAsPortalOwner()
    >>> wft.doActionFor(mship, 'reject_by_admin')
    >>> wft.getInfoFor(mship, 'review_state')
    'rejected_by_admin'

Now that he's deactivated, he should be able to reinvite himself
    >>> self.logout()
    >>> self.login('m4')
    >>> view.request_membership()
    >>> del view._redirected # necessary to display portal status message
    >>> view.portal_status_message
    [u'Your request to join "Project Three" has been sent to the project administrators.']
    >>> wft.getInfoFor(mship, 'review_state')
    'pending'

Simulate the user rejecting it
    >>> wfid = 'openplans_team_membership_workflow'
    >>> status = wft.getStatusOf(wfid, mship)
    >>> status['review_state'] = 'rejected_by_owner'
    >>> wft.setStatusOf(wfid, mship, status)
    >>> wft.getInfoFor(mship, 'review_state')
    'rejected_by_owner'

And try to request a membership, one more time, from the owner rejected state
    >>> view.request_membership()
    >>> del view._redirected # necessary to display portal status message
    >>> view.portal_status_message
    [u'Your request to join "Project Three" has been sent to the project administrators.']
    >>> wft.getInfoFor(mship, 'review_state')
    'pending'

Also check that we get redirected to login
if we try to request membership as an anonymous user
    >>> self.logout()
    >>> html = view()
    >>> delattr(view, '_redirected')
    >>> view.request.response.getHeader('location')
    'http://nohost/plone/login?came_from=http://nohost'
    >>> view.portal_status_message
    [u'Please sign in to continue.']

And as a logged in user trying to request membership to a project he already
has membership to, he should get redirected to the project contents with an
appropriate error message
    >>> self.login('m2') # project member on team
    >>> self.clearMemoCache()
    >>> html = view()
    >>> delattr(view, '_redirected')
    >>> view.request.response.getHeader('location')
    'http://nohost/plone/projects/p3?came_from=http://nohost'
    >>> view.portal_status_message
    [u'You are already a member of this project.']

We should get the same results with a project admin too
    >>> self.login('m1') # project admin on team
    >>> self.clearMemoCache()
    >>> html = view()
    >>> delattr(view, '_redirected')
    >>> view.request.response.getHeader('location')
    'http://nohost/plone/projects/p3?came_from=http://nohost'
    >>> view.portal_status_message
    [u'You are already a member of this project.']
