Move Blocking Content
=====================

Due to the sequence of operations in acquistion, persistent object may
ghost views, thereby overriding them.

We want to be able to migrate any namespace collisions if a new view
is added.  Currently our only adding is done by wicked and we use
dummy views to block names either used by deliverance or special
persistent objects.

A plain dummy view will block a path name::

    >>> proj = self.projects.p1
    >>> from opencore.browser.naming import ProjectDummy # FIXME: doug says this test needs to move
    >>> view = proj.restrictedTraverse('tasks')
    >>> isinstance(view, ProjectDummy)
    True

An ignorable dummy will block a name, but not trigger a renaming::

    >>> from opencore.browser.naming import IgnorableProjectDummy # FIXME: doug says this test needs to move
    >>> view = proj.restrictedTraverse('lists')
    >>> isinstance(view, IgnorableProjectDummy)
    True

Ignorable dummy is a subclass of ProjectDummy, and inherits the call method:
a raise that redirects to the preferences page::

    >>> issubclass(IgnorableProjectDummy, ProjectDummy)
    True
    
    >>> view()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Redirect: http://nohost/plone/projects/p1/preferences

First we will create some objects: one to represent an object blocking
a view, one for an object blocking a special persistent, and one
blocking a reserved path name (ala deliverance)::

    >>> self.loginAsPortalOwner()
    >>> import transaction as txn
    >>> id_ = proj.invokeFactory('Document', 'manage-team', title='Bad item')
    >>> id2 = proj.invokeFactory('Document', 'lists', title='Bad item 2')
    >>> id3 = proj.invokeFactory('Document', 'tasks', title='Bad Path')
    >>> sp = txn.savepoint(optimistic=True)

Let's make sure our content got renamed::

    >>> move_blocking_content(self.portal)
    >>> '%s-page' %id_ in proj.objectIds()
    True

But our persistent object did not (blocked by an ignorable dummy)::

    >>> move_blocking_content(self.portal)
    >>> not 'lists-page' in proj.objectIds()
    True

Anything in a deliverance path name (ie something we blocked with a
normal dummy) should be changed::

    >>> move_blocking_content(self.portal)
    >>> 'tasks-page' in proj.objectIds()
    True
