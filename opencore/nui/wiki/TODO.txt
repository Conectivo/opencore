File handling
=============

tickets:

- http://trac.openplans.org/openplans/ticket/16
- http://trac.openplans.org/openplans/ticket/1889


1. figure out the mime/type (reasonably)

2. Pick appropriate plone/cmf content types to save as

3. save in file repository (not the page)

4. save reference for displaying with page

5. migrate all existing attachments to proper file/image type and new
   location with proper 'linking'


Migrating old files to new location
===================================

pros:

  - everything in one place

  - deletion would be safe

  - single way of looking things up

issues:

   - have to fix existing links

   - extra migration steps

Migrating to new file types
===========================

pros::

  - file and image have better handling of media than fileattachment class

issues::

  - migration to new file types


Link continuity
===============

- store references to moved objects as annontation on container

- traversal adapter on container(project, memberfolder)

  - if traversal falls through, redirect to new location of attachment
