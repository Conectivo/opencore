====================
 Join by Invitation
====================

in response to `http://trac.openplans.org/openplans/ticket/1621`

This piece of architecture streamlines joining for users that have
received an invitation via email to join a project.  The invitation's
link points to a special view on the project, 'invite-join' along with
a unique key and the users email.  The view presents a join form with
a fixed email value and check boxes for any project w/ an invite for
the aforementioned address.
