 Team Membership Request
=========================

@@ needs more narrative DWM

Make sure the RequestMembershipWithEmail adapter is hooked up::
    >>> team = portal.portal_teams.p1
    >>> from opencore.interfaces.pending_requests import IRequestMembership
    >>> rm = IRequestMembership(team)
    >>> rm
    <....project.browser.team_membership.RequestMembershipWithEmail object ...>

It should have found a site::
    >>> rm.portal
    <PloneSite at ...>

We can find the logged in user::
    >>> rm._loggedinmember
    <OpenMember at ...>

We can construct an email to request membership to the project.
The helper method returns a (message, subject) tuple::
    >>> self.logout()
    >>> self.login('m4')
    >>> team.manage_delObjects(['m4'])
    >>> msg = rm._construct_request_email(request_message="Hi")

    >>> "Project One" in msg[0]
    True

    >>> "m4" in msg[0]
    True

    >>> "Hi" in msg[0]
    True

    >>> "\n" not in msg[1]
    True

    >>> from Products.CMFCore.utils import getToolByName    
    >>> mh = getToolByName(team, "MailHost")
    >>> len(mh.messages)
    0

The logged in user can request membership to the project::
    >>> rm.join()
    True

It will create a mail message too::
    >>> len(mh.messages) == len(team.get_admin_ids())
    True

If the user is not able to request membership, we'll find out::
    >>> rm.join()
    False
