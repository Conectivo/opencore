An authorized user can export a project's wiki pages as a zipfile of
html. Some caveats:

It doesn't include any project metadata;

It doesn't rewrite links or include attachments or referenced
images, so all links will be broken. ianbicking has probably
written a clever script to address this;

It only exports current versions of wiki pages; no other site content is
exported. (Notably not attachments).

Let's try it::

    >>> self.login('m1')
    >>> proj = self.portal.projects.p3
    >>> export = proj.restrictedTraverse('project-pages-export.zip')
    >>> data = export._get_exportable_data().read()
    >>> import zipfile, StringIO
    >>> z = zipfile.ZipFile(StringIO.StringIO(data))
    >>> z.printdir()
    File Name ... Modified ... Size
    p3/project_home.html ...

The actual view method returns an IStreamIterator::

    >>> iterator = export.export()
    >>> iterator
    <...export.FilestreamIterator object at ...>
    >>> len(iterator) == len(data)
    True

This view is restricted::

    >>> self.logout()
    >>> proj.restrictedTraverse('project-pages-export.zip')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Unauthorized: ...
    >>> self.login('m3')
    >>> proj.restrictedTraverse('project-pages-export.zip')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Unauthorized: ...
