 Project deletions
===================

Project deletion cascades a number of other events: external and
internal app deletion and the removal of the corresponding team and
all the memberships.

First, let's test our deletion handlers directly::

    >>> project = self.projects.p1

Let's add some featurelets::

    >>> self.loginAsPortalOwner() #@@ this should be the project owner

    >>> IFeatureletSupporter(project).installFeaturelet(TaskTrackerFeaturelet(project))
    Called httplib2.Http.request(
        'http://nohost:tasktracker/project/initialize/',
        headers={'X-Openplans-Project': 'p1', 'X-Openplans-Tasktracker-Initialize': 'True', 'Cookie': '__ac=...'},
        method='POST')

    >>> IFeatureletSupporter(project).installFeaturelet(ListenFeaturelet(project))

Flet Removal
============

    >>> from opencore.project.browser.preferences import handle_flet_uninstall

  << POST? shouldn't it be DELETE? egj? -- you think tasktracker is
  remotely restful? :P actually, tho, it shouldn't be DELETE, because
  it just flips a switch rather than really deleting any content. this
  might not be what project deletion wants, but it suffices to make
  the content unaccessible (until the next time that project's TT is
  installed) (hmm, this will be a problem if a new project is allowed
  to be created with the same name as the deleted one .. is that the
  case?) -egj >>

    >>> handle_flet_uninstall(project) 
    Called httplib2.Http.request(
        'http://.../project/uninitialize/',
        headers={...},
        method='POST')

Gotta reinstall::    

    >>> IFeatureletSupporter(project).installFeaturelet(TaskTrackerFeaturelet(project))
    Called...


Team removal
============

    >>> from opencore.project.browser.preferences import delete_team

Make sure delete_team does what it's supposed to; we'll kill a team we
don't need for this test::

    >>> p4_proj = self.projects.p4
    >>> delete_team(p4_proj)
    >>> sorted(self.portal.portal_teams.objectIds())
    ['.wf_policy_config', 'p1', 'p2', 'p3']


Put it all together
===================

    >>> project.getTeams()
    [<OpenTeam at /plone/portal_teams/p1>]

    >>> view = project.restrictedTraverse('delete')
    >>> view
    <...project/browser/delete.pt...>

    >>> deleting = view._handle_delete() 
    Called httplib2.Http.request(
        'http://.../project/uninitialize/',
        headers={...},
        method='POST')

    >>> deleting
    True

Free up the references::

    >>> del project
    >>> del view

p1 should be gone::

    >>> sorted(self.projects.objectIds())
    ['.wf_policy_config', 'p2', 'p3', 'p4']

The team should also be gone::

    >>> sorted(self.portal.portal_teams.objectIds())
    ['.wf_policy_config', 'p2', 'p3']

We should redirect to somewhere sensible... `start a project`?

    >>> print self.request.RESPONSE.headers['location']
    http://nohost/plone/projects/create

What else? [test wp, tt, removal]
