Migration to Xinha trunk/0.96.1 --

* Fullscreen mode not loaded

 Ticket filed with patch: http://trac.xinha.org/ticket/1534

* Toggle HTML Source broken
* Toolbar is not laid out correctly
* Formatting dropdown is incomplete; "advanced" options are broken (any of the ones that aren't just a simple string HTML tag)
* Gray skin is not applied, instead blue skin is
* Opencore CSS styles don't seem to be applied correctly within the editor
* Uses ImageManager and Linker; would be nice to use douglas's revamped Storage system if I can figure out the current status of that work on trunk

* Linker is not really correct

Also need to identify changes we made that never made it upstream - e.g. Doug's wicked-link-regex thing
