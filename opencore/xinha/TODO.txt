Migration to Xinha trunk/0.96.1 --

* Fullscreen mode not loaded
-> Ticket filed with patch: http://trac.xinha.org/ticket/1534

* Gray skin is not applied, instead blue skin is
-> This can be fixed by unloading the stylesheets (which are unused anyway ATM) or by setting them all to rel="alternate stylesheet"
-> But some (limited) stuff was already in use from the blue-look skin, which I've extracted into an opencore-skin.css

* Iconset is different
-> _editor_icons = "Classic" reverts the icons.

* Formatting dropdown is incomplete; "advanced" options are broken (any of the ones that aren't just a simple string HTML tag)
-> formatblock.diff (checked in to this directory) fixes this
--> need to document it and submit patch upstream
---> need to understand it a bit better
---> perhaps wrap it with an object (Xinha.Formatter?) to make it more self-documenting

* Toggle HTML Source broken
-> In wiki-edit-xinha.pt, in the document.write("<textarea") part, replace the textarea's "visibility: hidden" with "display: none"

* Remove "Decimal numbers" dropdown for orderedlist
-> Fixed by uninstalling the ListType plugin

* Add text to some buttons ("Link", "Image", "Table")

* Uses ImageManager and Linker; would be nice to use douglas's revamped Storage system if I can figure out the current status of that work on trunk
* Linker is not really correct (missing some <a> types, etc)

Also need to identify changes we made that never made it upstream - e.g. Doug's wicked-link-regex thing
