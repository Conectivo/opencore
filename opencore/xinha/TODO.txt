Migration to Xinha trunk/0.96.1 --

* Fullscreen mode not loaded
-> Ticket filed with patch: http://trac.xinha.org/ticket/1534

* Gray skin is not applied, instead blue skin is
-> This can be fixed by unloading the stylesheets (which are unused anyway ATM) or by setting them all to rel="alternate stylesheet"

* Iconset is different
-> _editor_icons = "Classic" reverts the icons.

* Toggle HTML Source broken
* Toolbar is not laid out correctly
* Formatting dropdown is incomplete; "advanced" options are broken (any of the ones that aren't just a simple string HTML tag)
* Uses ImageManager and Linker; would be nice to use douglas's revamped Storage system if I can figure out the current status of that work on trunk
* Linker is not really correct

Also need to identify changes we made that never made it upstream - e.g. Doug's wicked-link-regex thing
