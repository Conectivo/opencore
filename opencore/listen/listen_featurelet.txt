Add the listen featurelet to a project
    >>> self.login('m3')
    >>> proj = self.portal.projects.p1
    >>> from topp.featurelets.interfaces import IFeatureletSupporter
    >>> from opencore.listen.featurelet import ListenFeaturelet
    >>> fs = IFeatureletSupporter(proj)
    >>> IFeatureletSupporter(proj).installFeaturelet(ListenFeaturelet(proj))
    >>> proj.lists
    <ATFolder at /plone/projects/p1/lists>

The discussion list should have been created
And should have been registered in the list lookup utility
    >>> from Products.listen.interfaces import IListLookup
    >>> ll = getUtility(IListLookup)
    >>> mapping = ll.showAddressMapping()
    >>> len(mapping)
    1
    >>> sorted(mapping[0].items())
    [('address', 'p1-discussion@lists.openplans.org'), ('path', '/plone/projects/p1/lists/p1-discussion')]

And now we remove the featurelet
    >>> fs.removeFeaturelet('listen')
    >>> proj.lists
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    AttributeError: lists

And it should get unregistered from the list lookup utility
    >>> ll.showAddressMapping()
    []
