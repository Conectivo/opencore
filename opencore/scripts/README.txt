Random scripts for doing stuff related to opencore.
Mostly intended to be run via `zopectl run foo.py`.

Some of these were one-offs to extract information somebody needed, but they're
kept here as potentially useful examples since these things tend to come up
repeatedly...

See the source of each script to find out what it does. They should
all have docstrings.
