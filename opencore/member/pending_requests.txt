A simple adapter to annotate objects with a list of project ids to
store membership requests which should be created in the future.

It's really just wrapping a set.

    >>> m1 = portal.portal_memberdata.m1
    >>> from zope.app.annotation.interfaces import IAnnotatable
    >>> IAnnotatable.providedBy(m1)
    True
    >>> pr = IPendingRequests(m1)
    >>> pr
    <...pending_requests.PendingRequests object ...>

The member shouldn't have any requests initially::
    >>> pr.getRequests()
    ()

We store a few requests to join projects and then get them::
    >>> pr.addRequest("p1")
    >>> pr.getRequests()
    ('p1',)
    >>> pr.addRequest("p2")
    >>> pr.getRequests()
    ('p2', 'p1')

Adding a request which is already stored quietly does nothing::
    >>> pr.addRequest("p1")
    >>> pr.getRequests()
    ('p2', 'p1')

We can remove requests, but only if they exist::
    >>> pr.removeRequest("p2")
    >>> pr.removeRequest("foo")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    KeyError: 'foo'
    >>> pr.getRequests()
    ('p1',)

And we can remove all requests::
    >>> pr.removeAllRequestsForUser()
    >>> pr.getRequests()
    ()

Yay.
